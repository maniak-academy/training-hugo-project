## Managing Fortinet With Ansible and Terraform in AWS - A Comprehensive Introduction

![alternative text](http://localhost:1313/docs/overview.png)

Welcome to our exciting course on building a Fortinet Ansible Lab in Amazon Web Services (AWS)! In this comprehensive introduction, we will explore the intricacies of using Ansible with Fortinet, an industry-leading cybersecurity solution, and how it can be seamlessly integrated into the AWS cloud environment using Ansible and Terraform.

Throughout this course, you will deploy a secure VPC with GWLBN that will route all traffic throught the fortigate firewall in the central VPC. 

To manage the FortiGate configuration and deploy the infrastructure, we will be using Ansible and Terraform respectively. This powerful combination will help you automate and streamline your Fortinet deployment in AWS using the Gateway Load Balancer service.

With Ansible, you can easily configure and manage your FortiGate instances, ensuring that your security policies are consistently applied and up-to-date. On the other hand, Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it simple to create, modify, and destroy resources in AWS as needed.

Together, Ansible and Terraform provide a robust and efficient solution for deploying and managing your Fortinet environment in AWS. With these tools at your disposal, you can focus on optimizing your security posture and ensuring that your organization is well-protected against potential threats.

## Ansible 

Ansible is an open-source, cross-platform tool for resource provisioning automation that DevOps professionals use for continuous delivery of software code by taking advantage of an "infrastructure as code" approach. It's like a digital butler for your computer systems, making sure everything is set up and running smoothly. It's like a digital butler for your computer systems, making sure everything is set up and running smoothly.

With Ansible, you can automate tasks such as server configuration, application deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It's like having a personal assistant for your IT needs.

In the context of Fortinet and AWS, Ansible can be used to automate the deployment and management of Fortinet's security solutions within an AWS environment. This can help streamline the process of setting up and maintaining a secure infrastructure, making it easier to keep your digital fortress in tip-top shape.

## Terraform 

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tool that enables you to create, update, and version your infrastructure safely and efficiently. It's like a digital LEGO set for your IT systems, allowing you to build and manage your infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises data centers. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), making it easy to describe the desired "end-state" for your applications.

In a nutshell, Terraform is like a digital architect for your IT infrastructure, ensuring that everything is in the right place and working smoothly. It's a powerful tool that simplifies the process of managing your infrastructure, making it an essential part of any modern IT organization's toolkit.
